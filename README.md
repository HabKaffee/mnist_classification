This repository stands for laboratory work to subject "Machine learning tools".

Task:

- Solve classification task by hand-written neural network using numpy and trained using gradient descend algorithm
- Neural network consists of:
  - Two linear layers
  - relu and softmax activations
  - MSE loss
- It is prohibited to use autograd from neither PyTorch nor numpy
